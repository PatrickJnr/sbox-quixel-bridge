2. Open "Edit" -> "Export Settings"
3. Change "Export Target" to "Custom Socket Export"
4. Open the "Textures" tab in Export Settings
5. Select "TGA" as format (not actually necessary, but seems to be faster - PNG and JPG are both also compatible, but will
compile slower)
6. Exit out of "Export Settings"

2. Extract it somewhere permanent
3. Add it through the s&box addon manager
